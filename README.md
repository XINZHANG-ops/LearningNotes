What makes a good data scientist?

Data scientist includes 2 parts, data and scientist, so what is a scientist? Scientists are people who do research, experiments, to prove what they assumed is wrong. They make assumptions, they invent thoeries and they prove.

And what is data? Everything that can be converted as numbers or digits are data. Is a table data? Yes, it has weights, heights, materials, if you mersure it you have numerical data. And if you take a picture of it it has image data, if you call its name "table" you have text data. And when you have a lot of such data, you've created dataset, you will have distributions of data.

So a data scientist make assumptions, do researches, and make theories on data. And what can be studies on data? A physician studies relation between objects, a chemists study relation between molecules, biologists studies relation between cells. Data scientists study relations between data, more accurately, between collections of data, or distributions.
